# To Do

* re-work how file_path manifests are generated to:
  * handle directories
  * scope to passed in files / directories
* log results to csv file
* after tests are done (or blow up), send results
* add railtie support (for rake tasks)
* add non-railtie support so rake task works outside of rails too
* create CLI interface for running
